A wildfire has burned 90% of the village that recorded Canada's highest ever temperature, the local MP says.

Brad Vis said the fire had caused extensive damage to Lytton, in British Columbia, and to surrounding critical infrastructure.

Jan Polderman, mayor of Lytton, told the BBC he had been "lucky to get out with my own life".

"There won't be very much left of Lytton," he said. "There was fire everywhere."

Mr Polderman told the BBC's Newshour programme his town was engulfed by a "wall of fire".

He had earlier ordered people to evacuate, saying flames had spread through the village in just 15 minutes.

The village this week recorded the country's highest ever temperature of 49.6C (121.3F).

Abnormally high temperatures have been recorded in swathes of North America.

British Columbia, in western Canada, recorded 486 deaths over five days compared with an average of 165 in normal times.

"first":["US and Canada heatwave: Pacific Northwest sees record temperatures","""A heatwave has hit large parts of the US Pacific Northwest and Canada, sending records tumbling.

The US National Weather Service has issued heat warnings for much of Washington and Oregon states. Parts of California and Idaho are also affected.

On Saturday temperatures in Seattle, Washington State, reached 101F (38C), a record in the city for June.

Some cities have opened cooling centres, where residents can escape the heat in air-conditioned buildings.

The soaring temperatures are due to a dome of high pressure hovering over north-western United States and Canada.

Experts say climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, however linking any single event to global warming is complicated.

As the climate changes, there could be an increase in the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves, experts say.

The National Weather Service (NWS) said that even hotter temperatures were forecast for the coming days throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as parts of western Nevada and California.

Despite the warnings many people have been enjoying the sunshine, with lakes busy and pools running at full capacity."""],

"third":["Covid: Europe risks new wave, WHO warns","""

Covid-19 infections have risen by 10% in a week in Europe after two months in decline and the risk of a new wave of cases is growing, says the World Health Organization.

Regional director Hans Kluge said the risk had been heightened by sluggish vaccine rollouts, new variants and increased social mixing.

There was also a danger that Euro 2020 could act as a "super-spreader".

Hundreds of fans returning from London and St Petersburg have tested positive.

WHO senior emergency officer Catherine Smallwood called on host cities to do more to monitor the movement of fans.

"What we need to look at is around the stadia," she said, highlighting travel before and after matches. "What's happening after the games? Are they going into crowded bars and pubs?"
